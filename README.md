# Inside Computer Simulations

**Inside Computer Simulations** is a collection of various simulations designed to model and compare the performance of different algorithms in critical computer system operations. Each simulation includes multiple algorithms, allowing users to analyze and understand how different approaches perform under various conditions.

## Contents

### 1. **Processor Simulator**
   - This simulation models CPU scheduling and processing tasks.
   - Includes algorithms like **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out), **Round Robin**, and **Priority Scheduling**.
   - Compare how each algorithm handles process execution and scheduling efficiency.

### 2. **Frame Allocation Simulator**
   - Simulates the allocation of memory frames to processes.
   - Includes algorithms like **FIFO**, **LRU** (Least Recently Used), and **Optimal Page Replacement**.
   - Analyze the impact of different frame allocation strategies on memory usage and process performance.

### 3. **Hard Disk Simulator**
   - Models the operation of hard disk scheduling algorithms.
   - Includes algorithms like **FCFS** (First-Come-First-Serve), **SSTF** (Shortest Seek Time First), and **SCAN**.
   - Evaluate how each algorithm affects disk access time and overall system performance.

### 4. **Page Replacement Simulator**
   - Simulates page replacement in virtual memory systems.
   - Includes algorithms like **FIFO**, **LRU**, **ALRU** (Approximate LRU), and **Clock**.
   - Compare the effectiveness of each page replacement strategy in minimizing page faults.

### 5. **Processor Load Balancing Simulator**
   - Simulates load balancing across multiple processors.
   - Includes algorithms like **Round Robin**, **Weighted Round Robin**, and **Dynamic Load Balancing**.
   - Assess how different load balancing techniques distribute workload and optimize processor utilization.

## How to Use

Each simulation is implemented in Java, making it easy to run and modify the code for different scenarios. To run a simulation:

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory for the simulation you're interested in.
2. Open the Java files to view or modify the simulation algorithms.
3. Compile and run the simulation to observe the behavior of different algorithms under the conditions set by the simulation parameters.
