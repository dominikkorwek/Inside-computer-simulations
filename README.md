## How to Use

Each simulation is implemented in Java, making it easy to run and modify the code for different scenarios. To run a simulation:

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory for the simulation you're interested in.
2. Open the Java files to view or modify the simulation algorithms.
3. Compile and run the simulation to observe the behavior of different algorithms under the conditions set by the simulation parameters.
